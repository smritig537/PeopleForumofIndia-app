        strength of a person. Controlling one’s own 
        mind is inevitable for achieving success in 
        life. When the mind gets controlled then it is 
        easy to concentrate on a different task that is 
        confronted in daily life. There are different meditation 
        practices that are endowed with the effective techniques 
        of controlling the mind. These meditation practices make 
        your mind calm and steady. Therefore the greatness of the 
        mental stability can be seen, so that made meditation as a 
        significant activity in the day to day life. It is not recent that 
        meditation became a part of life.

        <br></br>
        Spiritual meditation is a practice of arousing the serpent 
        power, a biological energy in man. This energy is utilized for 
        the perfection of his very nature that is having a profound 
        meaning in his life. The awakened man meditates in the 
        energy centers along the spinal cord termed as chakras. 
        These chakras are related to various psycho – physical 
        qualities and meditating on these chakras are responsible 
        for balancing the energy and enhancing the power of the 
        mind. This meditation is also known as the kundalini 
        meditation, siddha meditation, chakra meditation, etc.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b className="w-full h-auto mb-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg">Kundalini – The Spiritual Power </b>
        Apart from other usual meditation practices, the spiritual 
        meditation involves the latent power known as ‘akundalini’ 
        to manifest. It resides in the base of the spine in the 
        sacral bone. The common meditation practices are 
        limited in controlling the mind to a certain extent and 
        do not go beyond that state of consciousness. 
        The power of mind in spiritual meditation is 
        limitless. The concentration of the mind can be 
        increased immensely. It is said that the highest 
        level of concentration is attained when the mind 
        itself withholds a single thought that would arise 
        successively as a chain. This is the state where the 
        mental waves get reduced and your actions become 
        clearer and effective. The spiritual meditation makes 
        one a mystic and it forges, as that it forges him as a 
        superhuman. But it is not an easy procedure. Know 
        your strengths - In spite of salvation as the ultimate 
        goal of this spiritual meditation, one would acquire 
        the enhanced mental ability; the power to achieve his 
        goals; leading a life that is consistent with nature. He 
        will have total control of himself so that the emotions 
        do not take over him.

            <h2 className="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-[#006442] mb-10 justify-center"> |5 Types Of Pranas|</h2>
           <p className="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg text-center text-justify text-[#006442]">We can live without sight, smell, hearing, speaking, and feeling, but 
           definitely not without the force that keeps them alive, that in Yoga is the 
           life-giving force called Prana.
           
           The term ‘prana’ finds its first mention in the 
           Vedas, widely acknowledged as the oldest 
           written text on our planet today. ‘Prana’ is a 
           Sanskrit word literally meaning ‘life-force’. 
           It is derived from two Sanskrit syllables 
           ‘prana’ which means constant and ‘an’ which means 
           movement. Therefore, prana means life force in constant 
           motion. This life force is the invisible vital energy that is 
           responsible for life itself. Our breath is the vehicle of this 
           prana and that is why when the breathing stops, the body 
           becomes lifeless. According to the Vedas, Prana is the 
           universal energy that pervades and vitalizes all matter. 
           It is this energy that galvanises sub-atomic particles 
           and atoms, which are the building blocks of all physical 
           matter. Thus, Prana is in sync with the Big Bang theory on 
           the origin of this universe.According to the Vedas this energy flows to every 
           corner of the universe ostensibly implying to the 
           constant motion of all planets and the celestial bodies. In 
           an earthly context, this creative pure original source of 
           energy is found in all objects both living and non-living 
           as both are an integral part of the universe. 
            As long as there is prana, there is life. The moment 'prana’ is extinguished, the body becomes lifeless. Thus, 
the yogis placed a lot of importance on this prana.The 
yoga scriptures describe five types of prana on.
<img src={Breath} alt="" className="w-full h-auto mb-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg"/>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<b className="w-full h-auto mb-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg">1.  PRANA VAYU </b><br/>
Prana Vayu in Sanskrit means something which flows 
‘inwards and upwards’. Named after the vital life force itself, 
this is the fundamental energizing force. It is an inward 
moving vital energy that resides and flows in the chest, 
primarily in the heart and the lungs region. It governs 
respiration and all intake, be it air, food, impressions, ideas, 
thoughts, feelings etc. It controls our perception of the world 
in general. And when this is low, we feel exhausted and 
depressed and have a negative view of everything around 
us. When it is flourishing, we feel charged and excited and 
perceive the world as positive. Prana Vayu activates and 
functions primarily in the region of the lungs and heart. It 
provides energy, vitality, enthusiasm and positivity. On a 
more subtle level, this vayu sensitises us to the environment 
both in terms of reactions and inner awareness. Weak prana 
Vayu can cause heart, respiratory and sensory ailments and 
mental depression and anxiety. When this Vayu is weak, the 
mind cannot function and the person experiences anxiety 
and shortness of breath at all times.
Yoga gurus endorse pranayamas like Bhastrika, Nadi 
Shodhana and Ujjayi Pranayama to increase the flow of 
prana vayu. Chest opening yoga poses that strengthen 
the lungs and heart region like the like Dhanurasanabow pose, 
Ustrasana - camel pose, Bhujangasana- cobra 
pose, Natarajasana - dancer pose, Setubandha asanabridge pose, 
Virabhadrasana- Warrior I, Utkatasana Chair pose, 
and Tadasana - Mountain pose are strongly 
recommended.<br/><br/>

<b className="w-full h-auto mb-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg">2. APANA VAYU</b><br/>

Apana vayu in Sanskrit means the ‘air that moves away’. 
It flows in the downward and outward direction. It resides 
and functions in the lower part of the body below the 
navel. It is responsible for all elimination, reproduction 
and sexual activity. It controls digestion, reproduction, 
and elimination. Weak or dysfunctional Apana-Vayu 
leads to ailments of the digestive, reproductive and 
excretory system. In a yogic perspective, this energy is not 
only responsible for the elimination of physical waste and 
toxins from the body, but also for the removal of mental 
negative energy and thoughts.
Since this prana eliminates, it needs a strong Prana 
vayu or inward energy to help it push with greater force 
and thus they are intrinsically connected. Understanding 
this energy also helps the practitioner understand the 
importance of letting go of thoughts and emotions which 
are negative as bottling these inside amounts to bottling 
waste. A constipated body and mind are equally harmful. 
Yoga gurus recommend Kapal Bhati pranayama and poses 
of forward bends and seated twists like Vrikshasana – tree 
pose, Ardh Padma Janusirsasana- bound half lotus head to-knee pose,
 Ardh Padma balance pose -.Half Lotus Tip 
Toe Pose, Marichiasana, Dancing natrajasana etc. Agni 
Sara Kriya, Ashvini Mudra and Mula Bandha are also very 
useful for this type of vital force.
<br/><br/>
<b className="w-full h-auto mb-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg">3. SAMANA VAYU</b><br/>
Samana in Sanskrit means ‘equal’. Thus, this is a 
balancing energy force. It operates and resides in the 
area beneath the diaphragm and the navel. It is the fire element 
Samana-Vayu that controls the digestion and 
assimilation of all substances. Its imbalance can lead to 
ailments of the stomach, liver and the large intestine. 
In a yogic context, digestion here does not refer to food 
alone but to digestion and assimilation of emotions, and 
feelings. This force can be strengthened by firming the 
Manipura chakra. 
A weak and imbalanced Samana Vayu causes 
indigestion and leads to lower confidence and anxiety. 
Yoga recommends Kapalabhati Pranayama with Uddiyana 
Bandha and Agni Sara Kriya and twisting and core strengthening 
yoga poses like the Boat Pose - Paripurna 
Navasana, Dolphin Pose, cat pose – Marjaryasana, Chair 
Pose- Utkatasana. Crane pose - Bakasana. Four-Limbed 
Staff Pose- chaturanga Dandasana, Happy Baby Pose Balasana etc.
<br/><br/>
<b className="w-full h-auto mb-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg">4. VYANA VAYU</b><br/>
The term Vyana-Vayu in Sanskrit means “outward 
moving air”. Thus, this prana moves from the centre of 
the body to the periphery. It controls the circulatory 
system and hence is responsible for the transportation, 
distribution and communication of oxygen, nutrients and 
impulses, etc. throughout the body. It also controls the 
muscular system which relies on the nerve impulses for 
voluntary and involuntary movement. It integrates with 
the other pranas keeping them nourished and stable. 
It functions through the nadis or energy channels in 
the body. A weak or dysfunctional Vyana-Vayu leads to 
aliments of the circulatory, lymph and the nervous system 
and may lead to serious mental issues due to impaired 
nervous system that relies on transmission and can cause 
acute deficiencies and skin problems.
Yoga recommends practicing Anuloma – viloma 
pranayama with kumbhaka and yoga asanas like the Sun 
Salutations – surya namaskar, Virabhadrasana I, II and III 
- warrior I, II and III,  Ardha Chandrasana -half moon pose, 
Garudasana -eagle pose etc.
<br/><br/>
<b className="w-full h-auto mb-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg">5. UDANA VAYU</b><br/>
Udana Prana is a Sanskrit term for ascending or that 
‘which moves upwards’. This energy flows from the heart 
to the brain. It controls speech and expression, emotions 
and thoughts. A weak or impaired Udana-Vayu can cause 
ailments related to speech, breathlessness, throat etc. It can result in the individual not being able to articulate 
and express emotions leading to extreme mental distress 
and agony. Ancient yoga scriptures believe that it is this 
energy that makes the soul leave the physical body and a 
strong Udana Vayu makes death peaceful and calm.
Yoga recommends practice of Ujjayi Pranayama and 
Bhramari Pranayama with Jalandhara Bandha and 
Viparitakarani Mudra to strengthen this vayu. Practicing 
inversions and back bending yoga poses such as Setu 
Bandha Sarvangasana - Bridge Pose, Sarvangasana 
-Shoulderstand, Halasana -Plow Pose, Matsyasana 
-Fish Pose, and Sirsasana -Headstand are strongly 
recommended.
The Yoga gurus at Carnoustie believe that a good 
understanding of these pranas is important for a 
practitioner to better understand how his/her Yoga 
regimen is fashioned and will be more physically, 
mentally and emotionally invested in it leading to better 
results.

           <p className="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg text-center text-justify text-[#33779b] mb-10 justify-center">"The body and mind are connected by the breath that directs the

           What is not visible to the human eye, seldom 
receives the importance it deserves, even 
if its presence is the very evidence of 
existence. According to Indian Classical 
thought, the primordial elements 
(Panchabhuta) are, Prithvi, Jal, Agni, Aksha and Vayu, of 
which the last one is undeniably the obvious indicator of 
prana (life) in a human body. “So long as the (breathing) 
air stays in the body, it is called life. Death consists in the 
passing out of the (breathing) air. It is, therefore, necessary 
to restrain the breath” (Hatha Yoga Pradipika,Mantra 3).
The ancient seers and sages knew the paramount 
relevance of vayu and they elaborated with precision and 
profundity in the Vedic literature, particularly the Sutras 
or Upanishads; that convey the meaning, ‘sitting close to the 
Master.’ Here, the iconic philosopher, Dr. Radhakrishnan’s 
definition of these scriptures is relevant: “The principal 
tenets of the darsanas are stated in the form of sutras 
or short aphorisms. They are intended to be as short as 
possible, free from doubt, able to bring out the essential 
meaning and put an end to many doubts; they must not 
contain anything superfluous or erroneous.” 
One of the many areas that have been significantly 
affected with urban living is Wellness. Commonly 
misunderstood as a disease free body, Wellness is a deeper 
concept that is the foundational principle of the Vedantic or 
Upanishadic way of being. In other words, it is the compass 
of the human mind-body framework. The condition for 
Wellness is directly associated with a healthy mind, in a healthy body. More importantly, according to Vedanta it is 
crucial to understand that ‘Mind is something distinct from 
the physical body on the one hand, and the spiritual Self on 
the other. Mind is an object of knowledge’. The preparation 
of which begins with listening, known as sravana in Advaita 
Vedanta. 
With its antecedents in antiquity, the term Yoga is 
used in multiple ways. For instance in the Gita, the third 
chapter is devoted entirely to the discourse on Karma Yoga 
thereby meaning, the Method of wherein the word yoga 
refers to a way or technique or system or method. While 
in the Yajnavalkya Upanishad, Yoga means the union of 
the individual and the supreme soul. However, Patanjali 
says that Yoga means effort and not coming together, 
or, as Bhoja says, “separation (viyoga) between purusa 
and prakriti.” Meanwhile, the oldest textbook of the Yoga.

              A
mantra is a divine word or a group of words, 
forming an integral part of any spiritual 
discipline. Mantras are commonly divided 
into FOUR groups. Praising mantras and the 
mantras for worship belong to the first group. 
The second group involves monosyllablc mantras known 
as “Beeja” mantras of which “OM” is the most significant 
and universally known. Then there are healing mantras 
both short and long, belonging to the third division. The 
fourth category comprises “Shanthi” mantras ending with 
“Om Shanthih! Shanthih! Shanthih!” For inducing peace in 
the physical, mental and spiritual planes.
It is a common practice to commence any yoga and 
meditation session or spiritual discourse with the following
This Shanthi mantra will ward off all negativity from the 
atmosphere and render the mind peaceful and conducive 
for learning. “Let us not hate each other” is a great principle 
in the yogic and spiritual way of human relations.
Upanishads are the classical texts of Vedanta, the Indian 
philosophy. Each Upanishad starts with a Shanthi mantra. 
The purpose is to create new divine grooves in the mind of 
the students. This will enable the mind to absorb the subtle 
spiritual principles easily and spontaneously.
People are often alarmed by the negativity prevailing 
and increasing in the world. The spiritual solution is by 
improving and purifying oneself for which we have another

Mind’ and ‘Prana’ are two great powers 
functioning in the human body. As 
human beings, we have the ability to 
control, purify, and manipulate these 
forces and make use of them for our 
advantage. Various methods of pranic energization are there 
in the Tantras which directly deal with the manipulation 
of pranic energy. Mantras (repetition of holy syllables), 
Tantras (divine geometry), and Mudras (gestures) are 
widely used for this purpose. Just as electricity can pass 
through conductors, likewise there are objects in the world 
which can be energized with prana.
In the human body, the prana is divided into five 
functional divisions - Prana, Apana, Udana, Samana and 
Vyana with another five subdivisions. Certain objects like 
‘Salagrama’ and ‘Sivalinga’ have preponderance of high 
frequency pranic energy, just like the idols in temples which 
are divinely attuned by the priests. For energizing oneself 
with prana, the practice of ‘pranayama’ and ‘mantra’ can be 
used simultaneously.
Self-energization with prana is a simple technique, 
commencing with ‘pranava mantra’ or OM (AUM) which 
represents supreme consciousness or ‘Brahman’. This 
mantra helps to integrate the body, mind, and soul. As in 
the case of any other technique, this practice also should be 
mastered directly from a guru.
The practice involves physical movements, pranayama 
(yogic breathing involving inhalation internal retention, 
exhalation and external retention) and repetition of the 
mantra. The practice should be done both in the morning 
and in the evening with concentration on the flow of prana<br/><br/>

              <p className="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg text-center text-justify text-[#339b96] mb-10 justify-center">In 1943, as the world was smack in the middle of World 
              War II, Abraham Maslow’s hierarchical approach 
              to human motivation took the world of psychology 
              and management by storm. The powerful image of a 
              pyramid of needs has been one of the most fascinating 
              ideas in behavioral sciences. Interestingly, this concept was 
              explained in the most detailed manner in the Vedānta or 
              the last chapters of the Vedas, one of the oldest, if not the 
              oldest scriptures known to man.
              This vedantic psycho-philosophical view of human 
              personality speaks of human personality layers that can 
              be nurtured and reinforced to refine who we are and how 
              we think and act. Called the Pancha Kosha theory, this 
              theory is the hierarchical theory of personality, a good 
              understanding of which is very useful in an individual’s 
              psychological and spiritual development.
              Central to this Panchakosha theory is the Atman or 
              the soul. This is the indestructible ‘eternal self’. This soul 
              encapsulates the complete universe or the Brahman. The 
              brahman is the definitive reality – the invisible life force 
              that pervades the entire universe. The texts quote an example to elaborate -
              “One teacher asks his student to bring him a fig. 
              “Open it,” says the teacher, “What do you see there?”
              “Some very small seeds, sir.”
              “Open one of those small seeds. What do you see there?”
              “Nothing at all, sir.”
              “Truly from what you cannot see, the whole fig tree 
              grows. That is Reality.
              That is Atman. That art Thou.”
              This atman (spirit or soul) is the purest self-devoid of 
              ego and falsehoods. Reaching this atman is the only way 
              to reach an enlightened state. The true purpose of yoga 
              is to nurture a trusting relationship between our mortal 
              human body and our immortal core where the atman or 
              soul resides. According to the Upanishads, the mortal 
              body has five distinct layers or sheaths called koshas 
              that protect our inner core, the home of the immortal 
              atman. Each of these layers or koshas have their own 
              vibration and can also overlap each other with fluctuating 
              energies affecting the aura or the personality of the is 
              nothing but our physical body comprising of our tissue, 
              muscles, organs and bones. This is the densest and the 
              sturdiest outer sheath and we can keep it healthy and free of 
              toxins by eating right (sattvic diet) and exercising regularly 
              for which Yoga prescribes various Asanas or postures.<br/><br/>
              <b>PRANAMAYA KOSHA</b><br/>
              The sanskrit term ‘Prana’ means energy. Prana is the 
vital force that moves through the body and keeps it alive 
and energised. Our breath or oxygen is the vehicle of this 
prana and that is why the moment we lose breath, the body 
becomes lifeless. Prana is responsible for the functioning of 
all the vital organs. For e.g. the prana makes the blood flow, 
carries nutrients from the digestive system to the rest of 
the body, nerve impulses to the brain and back etc. In Yoga, 
Pranayama is prescribed to elevate and increase this Prana 
in the body. Pranayama is a series of breathing exercises 
which aims at increasing oxygen supply in the body for a 
more efficient flow of prana or vital life force in the body.
<br/><br/>
<b>MANAMAYA KOSHA</b><br/>
The word ‘Mana’ means the mind. This kosha are the 
thoughts, feelings and emotions that govern the mind. This 
makes us experience the pain/sorrow and joy/pleasures 
of life. This Kosha directly impacts the other outer koshas 
and hence need to be healthy and gratified. For its health 
and rejuvenation, Yoga recommends Pratyahara (mental 
withdrawal of the senses,) to keep the mind calm and 
balanced. Pratyahara trains the body to withdraw from 
negative senses like wrong food, impressions, feelings and 
wrong associations. Pratyahara thus strengthens the mind’s 
immunity to reject negative influences. Just as a healthy 
body resists toxins and pathogens, a healthy mind starts 
rejecting whatever is negative for the mind. There are four 
main forms of pratyahara: indriya-pratyahara—control of 
the senses; karma-pratyahara—control of action; pranapratyahara—control 
of prana; and manopratyahara— 
withdrawal of mind from the senses. Each has its special 
methods. Visualization is one of the simplest forms of 
pratyahara because it clears the mind of all negativity and 
creates a foundation for positive thoughts. Pratyahara 
practices help us extricate ourselves from the momentum of life in 
general and other influences and helps us find 
peace and serenity within us creating a 
heightened self awareness and inner strength and 
prepares the individual 
for tapping his higher levels of consciousness.<br/><br/>
<b>VIJNANAMAYA KOSHA</b><br/>
The word ‘Vijnana’ means wisdom. This aspect of 
ourselves helps us understand life and its elements at the 
deepest. Working on this sheath helps us receive messages 
from the deepest levels of our understanding as we get 
closer and closer to the ultimate truth of the Atman which 
is the purest and hence the wisest. Yoga recommends 
Dharana, a deep concentrative meditation practice of 
getting the mind to focus and hold concentration on a single 
point or object excluding everything else, to strengthen this 
kosha. This trains the mind to be static enabling it to see 
clearly by getting in touch with the absolute truth. It helps 
the individual to tap into the higher levels of consciousness 
which refines our understanding and wisdom in sync with 
the universal reality. No wonder we were always told to 
‘think clearly’! This single focus cures the inner conflicts 
that disturb us and brings peace and mindfulness. A 
peaceful mind has a greater ability to tap into our inner 
wisdom.<br/><br/>
<b>ANANDAMAYA KOSHA</b><br/>
The word ‘Ananda’ means bliss. This is the spiritual 
sheath where you are the closest to striking the right spark 
or connection with the unequivocally pure ‘atman’ or soul. 
This sheath is activated when our conscious is connected 
to the unconscious mind. This is the highest vibration 
when you reach ‘Mukti’ or liberation. This is when the self 
becomes one with the soul. This is a state of eternal bliss, a 
state where the self is free of all attachments and desires. 
This is where the recommended ‘dhyana’ has reached the 
meditative stage. Very few are able to tap into this kosha 
and attain Samadhi or the ultimate liberation. The ones 
who do are seen as saints and evolved souls
Carnoustie Ayurveda & Wellness Resort believes that 
a good understanding of the Koshas helps individuals 
seek a guru who understands each individual’s unique 
interplay of koshas and helps customise a yoga regimen for 
balancing these koshas for better physical, psychological 
and spiritual health goals.
Focussing on just the asanas (postures) can only have 
limited physical benefits. We need to understand that 
Yoga is not a “ONE FIT FOR ALL” physical exercise but an 
extremely refined mind-body-soul concept and needs to be 
followed in the right spirit. Physical fitness is of very little 
value if the mind and the higher realms of consciousness 
are unhealthy. For e.g. there are famous personalities who 
have picture perfect physical attributes and yet suffer 
from depression. We need to appreciate that a healthy 
mind cannot live in an unhealthy body and vice versa. This 
reinforces Carnoustie’s emphasis on personalisation of 
Yoga.

               A Curative Heritage</h1>
               <p className="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg text-center text-justify text-[#fdba35] mb-10 justify-center">The marvel called the human body 
               has many gifts within its apparent 
               form. Movement is one such gift. An 
               aesthetically creative and refined 
               description of which is dance. In India, 
               forms of dance reflect tradition, heritage and 
               culture; the triad of its rich and vibrant multiplicity. 
               Appreciated as the ‘hidden language of the soul’, the 
               movement called dance emanates from a celestial 
               legacy. There is also a view that the movement 
               (dance) preceded the technique (yoga). However, 
               in the expanse of the Indian tradition, interestingly, 
               both enjoy the coveted status as flourishing 
               practices. 
               Another dimension of movement that manifests 
               artistically is combat sport. It is said that India is ‘a 
               citadel of martial arts’ that are “as old as the origin of 
               mankind” (Zarilli). Furthermore, the Indian martial 
               arts have influenced their Asian counterparts; 
               notable examples being the IndonMalay Silat, the 
               Burmese Naban and Bando, the Filipino Escrima and 
               Kali, the Indo-chinese kickboxing, Thailand’s Muay 
               Thai, Japanese Karate and Sumo, the Malaysian 
               Tomoi, Muay Lao from Laos and Pradal Serey from 
               Cambodia (Kidangil). Evidently, southern India 
               witnessed the fighting art as early as the sixth and 
               seventh centuries. In particular, the state of Kerala 
               enjoys the prestige of being home to an array of the 
               same. These include Parisa Kali (play with shield), 
               Valeru (sword throwing), Kunderu and Njaninmel 
               Kali (tightrope walking) and the most ancient one, 
               Kalaripayattu- the dance that teaches self-defense.
               Scripturally, the earliest mention of 
               Kalaripayattu is found in the Rig Veda and Atharva 
               Veda. In addition, the Tamil Sangam Literature 
               provides instances of the art being a popular 
               method of settling disputes between Indian nobles 
               during the ancient times. Hailed as the front-runner 
               of all martial arts, Kalaripayattu (pronounced as 
               Kalaripayatt) has been described as ‘an exhilarating 
               method of keeping a man fit and at the same time 
               offering a way of defending himself against an 
               aggressor’. The word, Kalari is derived from the 
               Sanskrit ‘Khaloorika’, meaning training ground; 
               the name is a conjunction of two words, Kalari and 
               Payattu. The former means gymnasium and the 
               latter, a duel.
               According to the Rig Veda, “Animals are, as 
               quadrupeds, on a par with—and not subordinated 
               to—men, as bipeds, remembered in prayers and 
               eulogies” (Gonda). Inspired from the movements 
               of snakes, lions, horses and other animals, 
               Kalaripayattu imparts skilled techniques displayed 
               with élan while engaged in fierce combat. Without a 
               doubt, such mesmerism is inherently quintessential 
               of the Indian classical traditions. The celebrated art 
               form that uses physical, mental, and perspective 
               senses, naturally encapsulates good health and 
               wellness in a uniquely systematic manner that 
               warrants a closer investigation.
               Discipline and practice are essential ingredients 
               for sustaining order in life. Both are invariably and 
               inadvertently compromised while attending to the 
               mundane. Our ancestors understood the value of 
               balancing these two ideals. Kalaripayattu is the 
               discipline that practices ancient knowledge as dance 
               for enhancing self-confidence and in recent times, is 
               being recognized as a rejuvenating wellness activity. 
               Acknowledged as the ‘mother of martial arts’, the 
               majestic form of Kalaripayattu adhered strictly in 
               the guru-shishya parampara enables the mind and 
               body to be vigilant. The seminal Ayurveda treatises 
               (samhitas) by Sushruta, Charak and Vagabhat are 
               the repositories of medical knowledge on which the 
               said martial art pivots. Thus, the ethos and approach 
               of Kalaripayattu articulates with reason based on a 
               scientific investigation of the human body.
               With the passage of time, Kerala’s crowning glory 
               combat art, Kalaripayattu has developed styles 
               and techniques that aim at specific areas of health 
               along with an overall experience of well-being. A 
               key aspect common in the varying styles is its four 
               pronged combat procedure; unarmed training, training 
               with sticks, training with deadly weapons, and training 
               to attack vital points. For instance, Vadakkan or Northern 
               school of Kalaripayattu consists of fighting with sword 
and shield as well as other metal weaponry such as 
churika and urumi. Training in this style is conducted 
with eight postures while movement is restricted to a 
straight line. This technique also has sub-categories of 
Kaluyarthipayttu and Kaikuthipayaattu. Contrastingly, 
Thekkan or the Southern school of Kalaripayattu stresses 
on empty hand combat, wooden weapons like the long 
staff, short stick or muchchan vati with an aim to strike 
the vital points; its training entails adhitada (hit and 
blow), hence is recommended for war. The practitioners of 
Thekkan adhere to Siddha system of medicine founded by 
“Animals are, as quadrupeds, on a par with—and not subordinated 
to—men, as bipeds, remembered in prayers and eulogies”
sage Agastya who is credited with the discovery of Marma 
(vital points) in the human body. The Marmachikilsa 
(treatment on vital points) aspect of Kalaripayattu stems 
from the great sage’s contribution
In Marmachikilsa, a reputed and widely acknowledged 
Gurukkal (Master) is the celebrated Dr. A.K.Prakasan 
who learnt Kalaripayattu from his mother, a combat 
arts specialist. The enlightened physician has over five 
decades of practice in the sphere of alternate medicine. 
He is recognised internationally for ‘Nokkumarmam’, 
‘Choondumarma’ (Finger pointing technique) and 
‘Udelkettu sastra’(Body protecting technique in the 
absence of physical force). Dr. Prakasan’s methods of 
kalari treatments focus on the power of the mind and 
mantras. Based on the fact that energy pervades our existence, he exercises contact less approach by pointing 
his index finger along with specific chants while treating 
patients. Having developed his own technique called, 
Atma Raksha Tantra (“The Universal Spriritual Martial 
Art”), Gurukkal Prakasan reinforces the ancient scriptural 
methods of healing through heightened spiritual and 
mental training. Considered a remarkable phenomenon 
in Kalaripayattu, Dr. Prakasan’s methodology validates 
the need for strengthening the core—mind, body and 
spirit
One of the reasons for the celebrated martial art 
regaining its coveted status in present times is the 
therapeutic aspect of the Ayurvedic treatments and 
unique massages that make Kalaripayattu an increasingly 
fashionable weight loss regimen. Highlighting the fact, 
Shinto Mathew, a seasoned Kalaripayattu Gurukkal 
and Founder, Kalari Kendram Delhi, the first Kalari 
shrine in Northern India explains, “It is one of the most 
cherished yet hidden treasures of India that needs to be 
spread for an indelible healthy mind, body and spirit.
